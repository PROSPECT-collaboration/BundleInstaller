# BundleInstaller
Shell script to download and build version-tagged bundle of PROSPECT analysis codes

This is a start at a proposed installation script for a more "official" PROSPECT analysis codebase installation.
The script configures cloning of a particular set of version-tagged git repositories for analysis, producing a well-defined installation "bundle."
Git versioning of the script itself provides the method to distinctly identify a particlar bundle to be used for analysis.
